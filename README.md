# QandAForum
QandAForum is a web
application project developed for university students to display
their questions, and gain knowledge regarding a particular
subject.
University professors and lecturers visit the web application
each day to solve problems related to a subject, share ideas
and resources to the students.
QandAForum brings together
lecturers from different department of the university to answer
the same question, in the same place â€” and to learn from each
other.
The main purpose of developing QandAForum is to computerize the traditional way of
communicating with the lecturers and professors to solve a
particular problem regarding the subject.
Another purpose of developing this project is to bring together
lecturers and students from different department of the
university to share their knowledge and to learn from each
other. This digitalized manner of communication with the
lecturers provides flexibility for the student to learn at any
instance of time.
